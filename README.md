# 🎬 TMDB Movie RecyclerView Task

A motion-rich movie listing application built using **React (JavaScript)** and the **TMDB API**.  
The project implements a **custom RecyclerView-style vertical carousel**, where movies are displayed **one by one** with smooth animations, blur transitions, and interactive motion flow.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this task is to demonstrate:
- API integration using JavaScript
- Reusable list rendering (RecyclerView concept)
- Interactive and motion-rich UI design
- Clean project structure and readability

Instead of a static list, the movie data is presented using a **custom animated carousel**, simulating the behavior of a RecyclerView with sequential item rendering.

## 🧠 RecyclerView Concept (Explanation)

Although RecyclerView is an Android component, its core idea is:
- Rendering list items efficiently
- Showing content sequentially
- Reusing UI elements instead of rendering all items at once

In this project:
- Only a **small subset of movies** is rendered at a time
- The **active movie** is highlighted
- Previous and next items are blurred and scaled
- Navigation rotates the list vertically with animation

This approach mimics RecyclerView behavior in a **web environment**.
